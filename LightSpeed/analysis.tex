The measurement of the distance between the rotating mirror and the concave mirror D is the sum of 3 distinct measures (from the rotating mirror to mirror 1, from mirror 1 to mirror 2 and from mirror 2 to the concave mirror), all done with a tape measure with a resolution of $0.015$ m??. The final value are:
\begin{align*}
    &D_1=(13.42\pm0.03)\,\,\text{m}\\
    &D_2=(13.33\pm0.03)\,\,\text{m}
\end{align*}
we took the resolution of the tape measure as the uncertainty on each measure, therefore the uncertainty in D is calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma_D=\sqrt{3}\cdot 0.01\,\, \text{m}
\end{equation*}
The distance a was measured with a ruler with a resolution of $0.002$ m??, and they were found to be:
\begin{align*}
    &a_1=(0.489\pm0.002)\,\, \text{m}\\
    &a_2=(0.482\pm0.002)\,\, \text{m}
\end{align*}
The focal length $f_2$ is known:
\begin{equation*}
    f_2=(0.252\pm0.001)\,\, \text{m}
\end{equation*}
The uncertainty on D,a and $f_2$ are constant for each measure of the speed of light, as such they contributes on the final uncertainty $\sigma_{ctot}$ as systematic errors:
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma_{c\text{sist}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial D}\right)^2 \sigma_D^2 + \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial a}\right)^2 \sigma_a^2 + \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial f_2}\right)^2 \sigma_{f_2}^2}
\end{equation*}
The measurement of the frequency $\nu$ is performed by the mirror's engine power source with a resolution of $1 \,\, \text{Hz}$, unfortunately the measurement wasn't stable, therefore we took, as the final frequency value, the semi-sum between the maximum value displayed and the minimum one. Lastly, the displacement of the light spot was measured using a micrometer with a resolution of $1\,\,\mu\text{m}$.
The final c value was calculated as the mean of the values in tables 1,2,3:
\begin{equation*}
    c_1=(3.14\pm0.12)\,\,\text{m/s}
\end{equation*}
where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean $\sigma_{\Bar{c}}$. To find the overall error we add in quadrature $\sigma_{csist}$ and $\sigma_{\Bar{c}}$:
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma_c=\sqrt{(\sigma_{\Bar{c}})^2+(\sigma_{csist})^2}
\end{equation*}
