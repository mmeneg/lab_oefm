    The calculated $e/m$ ratio in the orthogonal and parallel configuration was not compatible with the accepted value and moreover the distribution of the measured values shows an incompatibility with the theorical model. This was probably due to systematic errors in the measure of the diameter of the electron's beam circle. While the $e/m$ ratio measured in the antiparallel configuration (the third configuration in time order) was compatible with the accepted value and the measures compatible with the theorical model.

    The calculated horizontal component's intensity of Earth's magnetic field was compatible with the accepted value.
